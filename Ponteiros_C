//Variable:

int x = 10;

//Pointer:

int *p = &x; //The pointer p receive the address of variable x

             //Note: To assign the variable adress into the pointer after declare it: p = &y
             //     because *p after pointer declaring means to ccess the variable's valor and change it.

int main()
{
  
  return 0;
